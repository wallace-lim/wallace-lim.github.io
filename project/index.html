            Upsilon Pi Epsion, a CS honor society, holds semesterly initiation for the top 1/3 CS students, having candidates to professional requirements to help 
            them gain industry experience. Prior to slackbot, all requirements were tracked on a Google spreadsheet making it inconvenient for not only candidates 
            to look up their remaining requirements, but also for officers to check off 100+ potential candidate. Slackbot tackles this issue by centralizing all
            look up and check off to a 4-5 Slack commands in our main way of communication, Slack.

            Designed with jekyll and tale, this current website allows the ease of creating pages using mixtures of html and markdown. Jekyll removes the necessity
            to worry about appearance, especially media queries; thus, turns focus to writing through using defined layouts to automate page development. See more 
            into why I decided to go with jekyll over other techniques such as React.
