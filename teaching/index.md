## Overview

During my time here at UC Berkeley, I've always cherished the unbelievable learning experiences my university has to offer and I eternally grateful for all the course staff members having the patience to sit through with all of the students to ensure their success. I have wanted to give back to my community and help others growing into this large community. Teaching just seemed like the perfect choice.

Throughout my academic career, I have touched on a variety of computer science courses and am grateful to have the opportunity to help out the Data Science and Statistics department this upcoming semester as well.

[Computer Science Mentors (CSM)](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/) is a CS club here at Berkeley focuses on providing a closer teaching connection between the mentor and students. Because of the 300+ (sometimes up to 2000) students in every CS course, course staff members typically do not have the bandwidthh to allow sufficient attention for each student. CSM attempts to bridge that gap by holding mini-sections reviewing the past week's material with only 4 to 5 students in a room at a time. For more information, please see CSM's [website](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/).
