Hi there!

My name is Wallace Lim and I'm currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science. To be quite frank, I'm interested in so many aspects of computer science, full stack development, machine / deep learning, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity to name a few, and want to expose myself to as many topics as I can. My personal lifelong goal is to use my knowledge to help improve the lives of others. As general as that sounds, nothing makes me happier seeing others smile, and knowing that CS comes with infinite potential, it's the perfect opportunity whether that's inventing the "next big thing" or simply sharing my knowledge with others.

At Berkeley, I try to do what I can to help out the CS community thrive. I personally love teaching and sharing my knowledge to others. This Fall, I'm a course staff tutor for both Data100 ([Principles and Techniques of Data Science](http://www.ds100.org/)) and Prob140 ([Probability for Data Science](http://prob140.org/)) as well as a senior mentor for CS61C ([Machine Structures](https://cs61c.org/)) in Computer Science Mentors, a club specifically designed to hold small 4-5 people group sections to provide a mentoring aspect for students in CS classes which typically over 500 students. Along with that, I'm currently the Software Developer Officer for [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.berkeley.edu/) (UPE), the CS honor society strives to provide academic and professional developement to the Berkeley CS community.

Outside of academics, I spent my time decompressing through running around the neighborhood, practicing Wushu, a Chinese Martial Arts, or exploring more in the financial industry. I'm proud to admit that I'm a huge foodie and traveling addict. I love to travel around the world admiring nature's beauty and mankind's hard work while tasting many various culture's delicacies. I've already added 6 Michelin stars under my belt (1 - 3 star, 3 - 1 star) with full intention on experiencing more in the future.
