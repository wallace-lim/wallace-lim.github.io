Welcome!

I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science with emphasis on Business Analytics. 

This semester, I am a course tutor for both Data100 ([Principles and Techniques of Data Science](http://www.ds100.org/)) and Prob140 ([Probability for Data Science](http://prob140.org/)).

I am a senior mentor for Computer Science Mentors helping CS61C ([Machine Structures](https://cs61c.org/)) hold small group tutoring sections.

Over Summer 2020, I worked at Amazon as an Software Developement Engineer Intern.
